    <h3>What is The Aristocats?</h3>
    <p>The Aristocats is a 1970 American animated musical adventure-comedy film produced and released by Walt Disney Productions and features the voices of Eva Gabor, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Dean Clark, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers, and Roddy Maude-Roxby. The 20th Disney animated feature film, the film is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, and revolves around a family of aristocratic cats, and how an alley cat acquaintance helps them after a butler has kidnapped them to gain his mistress' fortune which was intended to go to them. It was originally released to theaters by Buena Vista Distribution on December 11, 1970. In 1962, The Aristocats began as an original script for a two-part live-action episode for Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color developed by writers Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe and producer Harry Tytle. Following two years of re-writes, Walt Disney suggested the project would be more suitable for an animated film, and placed the project in turnaround as The Jungle Book advanced into production. When The Jungle Book was nearly complete, Disney appointed Ken Anderson to develop preliminary work on Aristocats, which would mark the last film project to actually be approved by Disney himself before his death in December 1966, before the film was released.</p>

        <h3>George Bush is the Anti-Christ</h3>
        <p>Revelation says the number of the beast (the Antichrist) is 666 – it does not say this is the number of his name, though that could be part of it, but it cannot only be connected to his name or else it would have simply said so, and saved us the trouble of broadening our search.  It indicates that we are to construct the number by compiling individual digits "Six hundred threescore and six", so let's use his name for the first 6, and go on to the second number used by numerologists, the date of his birth.</p>

<p>Mr. Bush was born July 6, 1946.  If you add up all the digits in his date of birth  you get 7+6+1+9+4+6 = 33 = 3+3 = 6.  There - now we have our second six.</p> 

        <p>The third number used by numerologists is the "fate" number.  Many numerologists find the fate, destiny or ‘lucky’ number by simply taking the day of the month of your birth (and reducing if necessary) – since Bush’s birth day is the 6th of July – no reduction is necessary. </p>

    <h3>Why is The Aristocats Important?</h3>
    
    <p>OK, this might be a stretch, but what if Lord of The Rings wasn't about a group of traveling Hobbits and elves and other mythical creatures, but a family of high-class cats who sing songs and muck around the countryside. 
        <p>You might ask yourself, "Wow, why am i still on this website?"</p>
        <p>I would respond to that, "Well, this is my presentation and you can't stop me."  </p>

        <h3>Barack Obama is also The Anti-Christ</h3>
        <p>“Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.” Revelation 13:18 His number will identify him. 666
        
        <p>6 + 6 + 6 = 18 is the total number of letters in the name Barack Hussein Obama.</p>

      <h3>Where are they now?</h3>
    <p>Seeing as they're not real animals, but drawings, they can't die like you and I can. If they were real, though, they would most likely be dead, seeing as the movie came out in 1970, and also because cats do not live as long as people or other, larger mammals. If this news is upsetting to you, take some time to look at the picture to your right, of the cast of Aristocats, having fun whilst living, which they currently cannot do now, because they are once again, not real and couldn't possibly live to be 40 years old.

        <h3>The Cover-Up</h3>
        <p>The kingdom’s involvement was deliberately covered up at the highest levels of our government. Investigations were throttled. Co-conspirators were let off the hook.</p>
            
       <p> Everyone from Join Terrorism Task Force members to FBI agents and Virginia law enforcement say that despite evidence leading to the Saudi Embassy in Washington, investigations were derailed repeatedly by higher ups.</p>
            
        <p>Those sources say the pages missing from the 9/11 congressional inquiry report details ‘incontrovertible evidence’ gathered from both CIA and FBI case files of official Saudi assistance for at least two of the Saudi hijackers who settled in San Diego.</p>
